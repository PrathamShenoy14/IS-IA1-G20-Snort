# Making and creating directories

# Downloading snort DAQ(Data acquistion libraries)

wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/daq-2.0.6.tar.gz

#Downloading snort from source website

wget https://snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.11.tar.gz

# extracting and changing directory

tar -xvzf daq-2.0.6.tar.gz
cd daq-2.0.6

#Run the script and compiling it

./configure && make && sudo make install

#extracting snort source file and changing directory

cd snort-2.9.11

#Checking Snort version

snort -V

# To run Snort as NIDS we need to make changes

sudo gedit/etc/snort/snort.conf

# Then we create a home network and rules


# After configuring snort we need to test it, we do it as follows

sudo snort -T -c/eth0/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

# We see that Snort has been configured properly

#Then we install barnyard2

For this we install MySQL first and download barnyard2

Then we create MySQL database; Then we create a schema in barnyard2

# Next we install BASE

We download and install BASE and give the access to the database

# Then we can visualize the logs

#The snort-router setup is now complete


# Now we run as a NIDS mode as 

sudo /usr/local/bin/snort -A console -i eth0 -u snort -g snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf 

# Then we run barnyard2 parallely in another terminal and see that it is waiting for new data

# We can see the analysis using BASE

#Attacking

Now  we attack from the victim machine and see that the snort-router pops alerts

# Snort as NIPS

sudo /usr/local/bin/snort -A console -Q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0:eth1

#Now we run barnyard2 parallely in another terminal

sudo barnyard2 -c /etc/snort/barnyard2.conf -d /var/log/snort -f snort.u2 -w /var/log/snort/barnyard2.waldo -g snort -u snort

#Now we attack 

We see that the snort-router drops the packets and resets the connection.
