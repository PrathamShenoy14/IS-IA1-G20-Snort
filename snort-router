#For the snort-router machine we consider a Ubuntu Virtual Machine

# Installing packages
sudo apt install -y gcc libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev openssl libssl-dev libnghttp2-dev libdumbnet-dev bison flex libdnet

#extracting snort source file and changing directory

tar -xvzf snort-2.9.11.tar.gz
cd snort-2.9.11

#Checking Snort version

snort -V

# To run Snort as NIDS we need to make changes

sudo gedit/etc/snort/snort.conf

# Then we create a home network and rules

# After configuring snort we need to test it, we do it as follows

sudo snort -T -c/eth0/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

# We see that Snort has been configured properly

#Then we install barnyard2

For this we install MySQL first and download barnyard2

Then we create MySQL database; Then we create a schema in barnyard2

# Next we install BASE

We download and install BASE and give the access to the database

# Then we can visualize the logs

#The snort-router setup is now complete
