# Snort-Router Machine Setup (Ubuntu VM)  

## 1. Install Ubuntu and Update System  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## 2. Install Snort and Required Tools  
```bash
sudo apt install -y snort gedit
```

## 3. Configure Snort  

### Open the Snort configuration file:  
```bash
sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
- Modify network variables to define the **HOME_NET** (e.g., set it to your subnet).
- Customize rules as per your requirement.  

### Open Snort rules file and add custom rules:  
```bash
sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```
- Example rule to detect ICMP ping scans:  
  ```
  alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001;)
  ```
- Save and exit.  

## 4. Find the IP Address of the Snort-Router Machine  
```bash
ip a
```
- Note the **eth0** IP address; this will be targeted by the attacker machine.

## 5. Run Snort in NIDS Mode (Listening for Attacks)  
```bash
sudo snort -A console -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```
- Snort is now monitoring for intrusions.
