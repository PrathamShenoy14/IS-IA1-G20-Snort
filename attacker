# Attacker Machine Configuration

For the attacker machine, we use a Kali Linux Virtual Machine. The attacks are performed on the victim machine using network scanning with Nmap and flooding attacks with hping3.

We target the victim machine by using its IP address from the attacker system, executing various scans and floods to evaluate Snortâ€™s detection and prevention capabilities.

# Example
## 1. Perform Network Scanning with Nmap  
```bash
nmap -v -A <Snort_Router_IP>
```
- Snort should generate alerts for this scan.  

## 2. Perform a Flood Attack with hping3  
```bash
sudo hping3 -S --flood -p 80 <Snort_Router_IP>
```
- This will generate a SYN flood attack, which should be detected by Snort.  

## 3. Check Snort Alerts  
- On the **Snort-Router Machine**, observe the terminal for triggered alerts.
