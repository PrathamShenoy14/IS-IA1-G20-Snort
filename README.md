# Snort-IDS-IPS
Snort is one of the most commonly used Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS). In this report, we discuss all the essential steps required to install and configure Snort as a fully functional IDS/IPS. We also provide an overview of Snort's functionality by demonstrating real-world attacks such as network scanning using Nmap and flood attacks using hping3. This report presents a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to deploying Snort, along with the configuration of both the attacker and the victim systems.
